# This value gets embedded in gitstatusd at build time. It is
# read by ./Makefile. `gitstatusd --version` reports it back.
#
# This value is also read by shell bindings (indirectly, through

gitstatus_version="v1.0.0"

# libgit2 is a build time dependency of gitstatusd. The value of
# libgit2_version is read by ./build.
#
# If ./deps/libgit2-${libgit2_version}.tar.gz doesn't exist, build
# downloads it from the following location:
#
#   https://github.com/romkatv/libgit2/archive/${libgit2_version}.tar.gz
#
# Once downloaded, the tarball is stored at the path indicated
# above so that repeated builds don't consume network bandwidth.
